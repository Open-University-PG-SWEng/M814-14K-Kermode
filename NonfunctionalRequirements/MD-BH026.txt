REQ-ID:		MD_BH004
Description:	The appointment booking confirmation shall be obvious and timely.
Type:		Usability, Performance
Rationale:	To ensure the person creating an appointment knows their request has been excepted, an acknowledgement is required. This will help prevent multiple data entries for the same appointment and avoid unecessary waiting.
Fit Criterion:	Within a second of the user entering the mandatory data for requesting an appointment, the user will be notified of the request condition.  This message should be acceptable to 80% of users taking the roll-out survey.
Originator:	M Drennan
Quality Gateway:[SS] Pass
Comments: 	[MD] Derived from the functional requirement #26 "The product must provide confirmation that the requested appointment time/date has been booked successfully."

		[TM] What does completing the appointment request mean? Should not the message be agreed before roll out? 

[HB] Why three seconds? How was that number derived? Anything beyond 1 seconds will already interrupt the user flow (See Nielson, 1993)	

[PC] Some of the terms used are not well defined. What is an indication message? What are the request conditions? 

[CG] the rationale states that it will help prevent multiple data entries for time slots, however the fit criterion only specifies a 'request condition' - how will this de-conflict appointment requests?	

[AP] I think this requiremet is a (important) specification of the requirement AP_BH003. I would suggest we try to incorporate their purposes together. For instance, "A notification message (AP_BH003) shall be triggered within X seconds after the booking proposal has been issued" .

[FM] I think keeping it as "This message should be acceptable to 80% of users taking the roll-out survey." would be better

[SS] Is specifying the use of a message implying a solution involving text. Would "notify the user" be more appropriate here?

[MD] Comments on comments: 	TM - "Completing the appointment request" means the user has entered the mandatory data for requesting an appointment.  I have updated the criteria
				HB - I've modified it to 1. 
				PC - Warning and information messages would normally be defined in a separate document.
				CG - I'm refering to users trying to re-enter requests due to a lack of an information messages.
				AP - I agree with FM, trying to merge the requirements maybe out of scope.
				SS - I've modified the Fit Criteria

[JM] I like this fit criterion very clear and precise. I think this has passed the Quality Gateway.
