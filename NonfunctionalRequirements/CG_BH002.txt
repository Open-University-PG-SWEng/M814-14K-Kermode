REQ-ID:	 	CG_BH002
Description: 	The system shall allow receptionists to be able to locate specific patient details efficiently and quickly.
Type: 		NFR: Performance, Usability
Rationale: 	All receptionists will need the ability to determine specific patient details for a variety of reasons e.g. previous treatments and therapists, appointments missed, appointments booked.  This system search performed by receptionists will need to take place efficiently and quickly.
Fit Criterion: 	from system login, the receptionist shall be able to locate details of a specific patient within 15 seconds, in 95% of cases.
Originator: 	C Godfrey
Comments: 	[CG] derived from functional requirement REQ-ID: #011 in BlossomHill-Requirements.txt on 8 Mar 2015.

Suggestion (hbraun): The rational describes a function that shall be easy to use. As such the requirement type should be 'Usability' and not 'Performance'
		
		[TM] The fit criterion only covers quickly how is efficiently measured? Should there be a maximum time for all searches?

		[PC] This fit criterion looks good to me. It covers time for a search and gives 95% target. Could potentially add a number of actions taken to this.

		
[CG] Response to comments from [hbraun]: I deliberated over selecting one of these NFR types for way too long! - looking at the definitions outlined in MRP I think it could be argued either way. As such, both NFR types are now included.
Response to comments from [TM]: again, I wasn't too sure how to handle the 5% which exceeded 15s, as the reason(s) for search fail conditions are unclear. However I agree with [PC] in that bounding 100% of search cases may be unachievable.

    [AP] I agree with the requirements description, type and rationale. It seems a important NFR to be applied to the system and would surely be usefull on different areas where search is needed. However the Fit Criterion limits it only to the "system login", I didn't get it. Couldn't we replace ("from system login") with something like  (On places where "search for user data" is needed...)

[FM]i agree it is a good requirement although as [AP] mentioned changing it from "from login" would be better 


[SS] Another thought - is specifying "System Login" constraining us to a particular technological solution? Perhaps a phrase such as "from being able to access the system" would be less restrictive.

[OD] In agreement with a few here, I think the requirement is valid and complete given that the sentence 'from system login' on the fit criterion is removed.

[MD] Should the Fit Criterion indicate time from the end of the search data input, to the return of the results of the search? This would remove possible issues with slow data input.
