REQ-ID: JM_BH004
Description: Obtaining a session appointment data should be clear and easy.
Type: Usability requirement
Rationale: The sessions data will be used by the receptionist and therapist to manage the appointments and needs the patients so obtaining this information from a tablet or print out should be very easy.
Fit Criterion: It should take no more than 2 clicks of the mouse for an already logged in and valid user to obtain the days session of appointments.

Comments: [PC] Derived from functional requirement REQ-ID #002 

		[TM] 2 clicks of a mouse is a solution. This will depend where you are located before you run the test, if I am booking an appointment it will take me more than 2 actions to obtain the days session of appointments.

[HB] Removing the technology aspects from the fit criterion would further improve it. I.e. by stating that the session information should readily accessible from anywhere within the product.

[PC] The Rationale should not constrain hardware/process like "tablet or print out" as this should be part of the solution. The fit criterion should remove the reference to the mouse clicks.

[AP] Agreed with [HB]. In order to remove the 2 clicks constraint, perhaps you could suggest something like: "The number of actions to access the appointment must be the same across the system"

[FM]I dont know the two clicks does seem like a good Fit Criterion. and it seems like a good way to test ease of use. 

[SS] Use of the phrase 'logged in' suggests a solution requiring logging in is implemented. Perhaps avoiding this by something along the lines of "a valid user who is currently using the system" would be better.

[SS] Punctuation could be important here 'days session of appointments' needs an apostrophe in "days" - the problem is that the location of it changes the meaning of the phrase.

[OD] I think this is a valid and testable NFR

[MD] Agree with AP that 'actions' would be a better test criteria.  2 actions would however be difficult to achieve if the user was alreadly entering data for another function.
