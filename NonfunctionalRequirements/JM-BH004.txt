REQ-ID: JM_BH004
Description: Obtaining a session appointment data should be clear and easy.
Type: Usability requirement
Rationale: The session`s data will be used by the receptionist and therapist to manage the appointments and needs the patients so obtaining this information from a tablet or print out should be very easy.
Fit Criterion: It should take no more than 2 actions for an autorized user to obtain the day's session of appointments.

Comments: [PC] Derived from functional requirement REQ-ID #002 

		[TM] 2 clicks of a mouse is a solution. This will depend where you are located before you run the test, if I am booking an appointment it will take me more than 2 actions to obtain the days session of appointments.

[HB] Removing the technology aspects from the fit criterion would further improve it. I.e. by stating that the session information should readily accessible from anywhere within the product.

[PC] The Rationale should not constrain hardware/process like "tablet or print out" as this should be part of the solution. The fit criterion should remove the reference to the mouse clicks.

[AP] Agreed with [HB]. In order to remove the 2 clicks constraint, perhaps you could suggest something like: "The number of actions to access the appointment must be the same across the system"

[FM]I dont know the two clicks does seem like a good Fit Criterion. and it seems like a good way to test ease of use. 

[SS] Use of the phrase 'logged in' suggests a solution requiring logging in is implemented. Perhaps avoiding this by something along the lines of "a valid user who is currently using the system" would be better.

[SS] Punctuation could be important here 'days session of appointments' needs an apostrophe in "days" - the problem is that the location of it changes the meaning of the phrase.

[OD] I think this is a valid and testable NFR

[MD] Agree with AP that 'actions' would be a better test criteria.  2 actions would however be difficult to achieve if the user was alreadly entering data for another function.

[JM] The two clicks is an assumption, but I think a valid one and I dont think its a solution in an out of itself but I have changed the wording "actions" because that allows for more options, like shorcut keys as well as mouse clicks. 

The logged in is to clearly mean that you have to be logged in because I pressumed various other functions wouldn require you to be logged into the system. But again I have changed the terminology to "authorized" which is less restrictive in terms of implementation and a lot more consize.

I also added an apostrophy as suggested for clarity.
