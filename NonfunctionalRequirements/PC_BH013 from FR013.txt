REQ-ID: PC-BH013
Description: The ability to access the availability and absence of therapists should be restricted to authorized users only.
Type: Security requirement
Rationale: The availability and absence of therapists is considered private data and should not be made available to unauthorized users.
Fit Criterion: Only authorized users should be able to access availability and absence of therapists.
Originator: Paul Cooney
Quality Gateway: [SS] Pass [AL] Pass [AP] Pass
Comments: [PC] Derived from functional requirement REQ-ID #013 - The product shall display the availability and absence of therapists. Assumption exists that receptionist is a clearly defined role.

Comments: (odovao) - Although receptionists are the regular users of therapists' availability information, I would not strictly restrict it to receptionist as there may be cases in which other employers, such as office managers, would want to use this information for other business processes, including producing revenue predictions or growth planning.

		[TM] The rationale is confusing "should not be made available to unauthorized users only". The fit criterion is a repeat of the NFR, it does not add anything. 

[HB] Are these legal requirements, security requirements, or both?
[PC] Updated the typo in the rationale.
[AP] Considering that this is clearly a point for discussion (Who should have access to these information), couldn't we propose something like: "Only a specific group of users can have access to this information" instead of limiting it to the receptionists only ?

[SS] As it stands the fit criterion does conflict with the rationale - in that one suggests authorised users whereas the other only receptions can access the information. Removing specific roles from the fit criterion would resolve this.

[PC] I agree with these comments and I will update the fit criterion to authorized users only to make this consistant and a more re-usable implementation. I will update this once all comments are submitted.

[MD] I agree that more than just the Receptionists may need access to this data.  The Fit Criterion will however need specific roles, or it will be difficult to test?

[FM]Yes updating to authorized users would be better

[JM] I like this fit criterion very clear and precise. I think this has passed the Quality Gateway.
