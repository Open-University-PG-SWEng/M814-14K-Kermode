REQ-ID:         AP_BH003
Description:    Systems notifications must catch the user’s attention
Type:           Usability
Rationale:      Users must not overlook important system notifications that require further user-dependent actions. For instance, on REQ-ID: #006, failing to send the reminder letters can increase the possibility of the patients missing/forgetting their next appointments. 
Fit Criterion:  An audible and visual notification must appear on the screen (e.g.: a pop-up screen/window) preventing the user to proceed with further system actions until a confirmation that the current “System notification” has been acknowledged by the user, e.g.: the “OK” button is pressed.
Originator:     A Perico
Comments:       [AP] derived from REQ-ID: #006 (BlossomHIll-Requirements.txt 8 Mar 2015).

Suggestion (hbraun): In my opinion, this is a description of a functional requirement. It doesn't describe a quality of the a products function, but a function itself. I would suggest to use the given information to update the REQ-ID #006 and remove this one.  
comments:  (odovao) - The fit criterion does not measure the effectiveness of the requirement's goal i.e. consistently sending treatment notification to patients. My suggestion is to include a sentence of the kind to the fit criterion; 95% of the receptionist send the letter notification within 2 hours following a system alert.
		[TM] The fit criterion should be a way to test the requirement, it should not be a solution. You could state that the notification needs to noticed in under a set time. Preventing the user proceeding is ok.
