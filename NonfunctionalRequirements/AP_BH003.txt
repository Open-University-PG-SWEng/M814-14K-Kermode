REQ-ID:         AP_BH003
Description:    System notifications must catch the user's attention
Type:           Usability

Rationale:      Users must not overlook important system notifications. When a notification does not catch user's attention, it might introduce confusion (when triggered too late) or it can simply be ignored.

Fit Criterion:  User's will respond to a notification within 3 seconds in 90% of cases.

Originator:     A Perico

Suggestion (hbraun): In my opinion, this is a description of a functional requirement. It doesn't describe a quality of the a products function, but a function itself. I would suggest to use the given information to update the REQ-ID #006 and remove this one.  

Answer (aperico) -> @hbraun: Interesting point however, I think there is room for interepretation here.
    REQ #006 says: "The system shall notify the user in case the next treatment chosen is after 2 working days".
From what I undestood, it tells that the notification shall happen, but not when. For instance, it could be every 2 hours or 1 hour before the working day ends for the receptionist. I still think we should keep this as a NFR - I am changing it slightly to make it more generic. (If you guys still think we should move to Functional, I am also fine with that)

comments:  (odovao) - The fit criterion does not measure the effectiveness of the requirement's goal i.e. consistently sending treatment notification to patients. My suggestion is to include a sentence of the kind to the fit criterion; 95% of the receptionist send the letter notification within 2 hours following a system alert.
		
		[TM] The fit criterion should be a way to test the requirement, it should not be a solution. You could state that the notification needs to noticed in under a set time. Preventing the user proceeding is ok. 
                
		[FM]I agree yes or something along the lines of "System notifications are be acknowledged within 2 hours"

Answer (aperico) -> (odovao): Thanks for the suggestion - I hope I have managed to get it now. I decided to change this requirement to simply catch
generic cases instead of the letter notification only.

[CG] for the fit criterion, I feel there may be ambiguity over the scope of 'it'. Without prescribing a solution, this element would be worth clarifying.

[SS] The fit criterion uses the phrase "Important notifications" whereas the description uses "System notifications" - if these are synonymous then I would recommend consistency and use "system notification" throughout. If they are different then perhaps we need a better understanding of what 'important' means in this context.

[PC] The fit criterion appears to be a solution then a test of the requirment. Could be more like the notificaion must be noticed within 3 seconds in 90% of cases.

[MD] The given Fit Criterion does seem to be an additional functional requirement on the system.  This could be included as part of REQ-ID #006 and then modify this NFR to suite.

[AP] Agreed with [PC] and [MD]. [PC] I am using your suggestion for the fit criterion. I think it must be up to the solution (or another NRF) to decide whether is necessary to block the system for further usage or not.

[JM] "The notificaion must be noticed within 3 seconds" How are you going to meassure that? I think you mean to say "User's will respond to a notification within 3 seconds", which implies the user has to click to make it go away before they can continue doing any work. Also there is a typo in notification.

[AP] Sounds good to me.
