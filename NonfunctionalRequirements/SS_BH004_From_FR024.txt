REQ-ID: 	SS_BH04
Description:	It should be easy for a user to record the 'no show' reduction method.
Type:		Usability
Rationale:	The office manager wishes to try different ideas to reduce no shows. Recording them enables later analysis of their efficacy. This process needs to be straightforward to encourage the timely and accurate recording of the data.
Fit Criterion:	Authenticated users shall, on their first attempt, be able to record 90% of all attempts reduce "no shows" within 20 seconds of having access to the system functionality. 
Originator:	S Savage
Quality Gateway: [PC] Pass
Comments: 	[SS] Derived from functional requirement with Req ID #24 as detailed in BlossomHill-Requirements.txt (08-Mar-2015)
		
		[TM] What does 20 seconds of engaging with the system mean? Is it 20 seconds from logging in or 20 seconds from first use? 20 seconds from first use seems a very short duration. Accuracy should be part of a functional requirement.

[SS] Engaging with the system was an attempt to avoid specific solutions such as logging on although, in essence, it is from the point of having gone through user authentication and currently having access to the system. I see your point about accuracy and will remove it.

[HB] I think rational of #24 shows that the requirement is incomplete ("try different ideas"). The methods to reduce no-shows are possible future enhancements. As such this requirement could be considered a maintainability requirement. 

[SS] I agree to the extent that if the methods were to be implemented as part of the new system then this would indeed be maintenance. However, there are other options available - for example a quick phone call the day before - which need to be recorded.

[PC] There is a disconnection between the description and the fit criterion/rationale. The fit criterion/rationale makes no reference to recording the reduction method on their first attempt.

[AP] a) Perhaps the description should focus on the usability aspect of the problem. b) Move the idea of "on their first attempt" to be discussed on the Fit Critetion so it can be used as a mesurement to test the requirement.

[SS] PC & AP - interesting thoughts. I agree although I'm not sure if we are outside of the scope of the TMA in that we are asked to focus on the fit criterion so am not sure if we can edit the description - will read up on this.

[SS] Changed Description to remove "on their first attempt"
[SS] Changed fit criterion to make it clearer when timing could start from; removed accuracy criterion but added on first attempt.

[MD] Now modified so comments may differ from previous.  Rather than "system functionality" as a fit criteria time start point, could we use the moment we start data input for this functionality? 

[FM] agree would be better to start from when the attempt to input the no show 

[AP] Sorry, I don't mean to be pedantic, but perhaps my english is simply not good enough. I can't understand the meaning behind the Fit Criterion yet, specifically on this sentence: "..be able to record 90% of all attempts reduce "no shows" within 20 seconds of having access to the system functionality". 
It appears to me that it aims to extract information about the "attempts to reduce the no show" and not about "the list of patients that misses their appointments". Shouldn't it be something like: Authenticated users shall, on their first attempt, be able to acess the list of patients that missed their appointments within 20 seconds?

[PH] After the changes this is a very workable requirement and I personally would think it would pass. However [AP]s last comment should be addressed beforehand or the completeness criterion may be failed at the gate for not being clear enough
