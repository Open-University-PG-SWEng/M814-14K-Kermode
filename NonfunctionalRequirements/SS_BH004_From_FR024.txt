REQ-ID: 	SS_BH04
Description:	It should be easy for a user to record the 'no show' reduction method on their first attempt.
Type:		Usability
Rationale:	The office manager wishes to try different ideas to reduce no shows. Recording them enables later analysis of their efficacy. This process needs to be straightforward to encourage the timely and accurate recording of the data.
Fit Criterion:	Users shall be able to record 90% of all attempts reduce "no shows" within 20 seconds of engaging with the system. All such recorded data shall reflect the actual reduction method used.
Originator:	S Savage
Comments: 	[SS] Derived from functional requirement with Req ID #24 as detailed in BlossomHill-Requirements.txt (08-Mar-2015)
		
		[TM] What does 20 seconds of engaging with the system mean? Is it 20 seconds from logging in or 20 seconds from first use? 20 seconds from first use seems a very short duration. Accuracy should be part of a functional requirement.

[HB] I think rational of #24 shows that the requirement is incomplete ("try different ideas"). The methods to reduce no-shows are possible future enhancements. As such this requirement could be considered a maintainability requirement.
