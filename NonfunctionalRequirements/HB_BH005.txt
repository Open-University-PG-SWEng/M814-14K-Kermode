Rationale:	The receptionists work with product on day to day basis. Many of the clerical activities are repeated over and over again. To provide ongoing efficiency the product needs to be easy to use.
Fit Criterion:	A receptionist shall be able to propose three different possible appointment slots within 30 seconds.
Originator:	Heiko Braun	
Comments: 	Relates to functional requirement #014.

Comments:   (odovao) The fit criterion does not measure the entire extend of the description’s scope, as finding a number booking slots rapidly is not the only aspect of the system which affects usability. In such case I would suggest to adjust the requirement's description so that is fully covered by the fit criterion. Also this requirement could be considered a duplicate of TM_BH001.
		
		[TM] Only the fit criterion relates to #14. The NFR is generic, should it not specifically relate to FR #014 otherwise it could relate to multiple FRs.

		[PC] The description and rationale should be updated to in line with the functional requirement #014 and the proposed fit criterion.

        [AP] To avoid ambiguity, shouldn't the decription and the Reationale be more "focused" on the "Proposing different appointment slots ?". Perhaps, another requirement might similar description but focusing on another solution. e.g: "Checkout//payment handling" instead of "Proposing different appointment slots".

[FM] As mentioned above you would either need to change the fit Criterion or change your NFR. Although the NFR is a good one in my opinion 

[SS] When on the 30 seconds measured from? This will be needed so that the time can be measured and check against the fit-criterion.

[MD] I think the Fit Criterion are good, although as stated above, the time constraint requires an initiator.  The Description however doesn't relate very closely to the functional requirement.
