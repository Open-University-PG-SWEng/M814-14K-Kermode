REQ-ID:         HB_BH005
Description:	It shall be easy for the receptionists to propose different appointment slots.
Type:		Usability
Rationale:	Proposing appointments is an activity often executed on a short attention span, i.e. when a patient calls in to change his appoinment or while other's are waiting in line. Typically a receptionist has one to two minutes for each inquiry on the phone. Hence it should be efficient and simple to find and propose alternative appointment slots.
Fit Criterion:	A receptionist shall be able to propose three different possible appointment slots within 30 seconds.

Comments: 	Relates to functional requirement #014.

Comments:   (odovao) The fit criterion does not measure the entire extend of the description’s scope, as finding a number booking slots rapidly is not the only aspect of the system which affects usability. In such case I would suggest to adjust the requirement's description so that is fully covered by the fit criterion. Also this requirement could be considered a duplicate of TM_BH001.
		
		[TM] Only the fit criterion relates to #14. The NFR is generic, should it not specifically relate to FR #014 otherwise it could relate to multiple FRs.

		[PC] The description and rationale should be updated to in line with the functional requirement #014 and the proposed fit criterion.

        [AP] To avoid ambiguity, shouldn't the decription and the Reationale be more "focused" on the "Proposing different appointment slots ?". Perhaps, another requirement might similar description but focusing on another solution. e.g: "Checkout//payment handling" instead of "Proposing different appointment slots".

[FM] As mentioned above you would either need to change the fit Criterion or change your NFR. Although the NFR is a good one in my opinion 

[SS] When on the 30 seconds measured from? This will be needed so that the time can be measured and check against the fit-criterion.

[MD] I think the Fit Criterion are good, although as stated above, the time constraint requires an initiator.  The Description however doesn't relate very closely to the functional requirement.

[JM] The description applies to the product as a whole, while the fit rationale applies to only one specific fucntion of the project. Either the description is wrong or the fit criterion is wrong... For the chosen description I would use a fit criterion related to using the whole of the system, something like "no more than 3 actions" or "no more more than 30 seconds to perform any one task". For the chosen fit criterion I think your description should related to appointments specifically.

[AP] I agree with [JM], for me it seems that the Description and the Rationale used here can be used on other NFR too (perhaps introducing condusion ?!). Shouldn't the description be something like: "It shall be easy for the receptionists to propose different appointment slots ?"
