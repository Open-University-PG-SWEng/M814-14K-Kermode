REQ-ID:		TM_BH001
Description:	The system shall allow free timeslots to be found in an efficient manner
Type:		Usability, Performance
Rationale:	The receptionist needs to search for free timeslots for a therapist to book an appointment for a patient, to improve the efficiency of the booking process this needs to be both straightforward and timely
Fit Criterion:	The receptionist should be able to find free timeslots in under 10 seconds, using no more than 5 actions.
Originator:	T McMahon
Comments: 	[TM] Type from MRP p249, p250 states that multiple types can be used
		[TM] Relates to functional requirement #005

		[HB] "Finding" timeslots can describe the task of a user or a function of the system (i.e. querying data). It needs to be specified wether the system should respond within 10 seconds (i.e. provide search results) or if the user should be able to identify free slots within that time.		
		[TM] The fit criterion states the user (i.e. receptionist), the user action encapsulates the system action. The 10 seconds is the overall time including completing the search form, running the search and returning results. I do not want to mention search forms and running searches because this would cross into solutionizing. 
		[PC] This fit criterion looks complete and valid to me.
