REQ-ID:		TM_BH001
Description:	The system shall allow free timeslots to be found in an efficient manner
Type:		Usability, Performance
Rationale:	The receptionist needs to search for free timeslots for a therapist to book an appointment for a patient, to improve the efficiency of the booking process this needs to be both straightforward and timely
Fit Criterion:	From anywhere in the product the receptionist should be able to find free timeslots in under 10 seconds, using no more than 5 actions.
Originator:	T McMahon
Comments: 	[TM] Type from MRP p249, p250 states that multiple types can be used
		[TM] Relates to functional requirement #005

		[HB] "Finding" timeslots can describe the task of a user or a function of the system (i.e. querying data). It needs to be specified wether the system should respond within 10 seconds (i.e. provide search results) or if the user should be able to identify free slots within that time.		
		[TM] The fit criterion states the user (i.e. receptionist), the user action encapsulates the system action. The 10 seconds is the overall time including completing the search form, running the search and returning results. I do not want to mention search forms and running searches because this would cross into solutionizing. 
		[PC] This fit criterion looks complete and valid to me.
        [AP] I think all has been fixed by the time I got here, looks complete to me.
	[SS] In order to test the fit criterion we need an start point for the 10 seconds - but not sure how you could express that point here withou crossing into specifying a solution for the search.
        [OD] In order to make this NFR testable, 'actions' needs to be explained as it's a very broad term in the software context and can lead to ambiguity, and also from where these actions start counting needs to be predetermined.
	[TM} The term 'actions' would be explained in a data dictionary (MRP, p314) not in the NFR
	[TM] I have updated the fit criterion in line with comments from [SS] and [OD] re: where does the test start from

	[MD] The fit criterion seems to test the requirement adequately now.
	[FM] Yes i agree

	[JM] I like this fit criterion very clear and precise. I think this has passed the Quality Gateway.
