REQ-ID: 	AL_BH028
Description: 	The patient shall receive the appointment booking information within a reasonable time
Type:  		Performance, Usability
Rationale: 	To provide a responsive appointment system that is usable and meets user ex-pectation.
Fit Criterion: 	The web page must respond with the appointment details within 15 seconds of the patients request in 95% of cases.
Originator: 	A Lebby

Comments: 	[AL] Requirement derived from functional requirements #028 E‘The system should let patients view appointments on a websiteE

--

Suggestion (hbraun): It's not clear how the response time limit is derived. Why exactly 8 seconds? I would suggest to improve the rational to explain how patients access the web site (mobile phone, dsl, etc) based on the technical constraints determine a reasonable response time limit.     
		
		[TM] What is the source of the 8 seconds? Is 8 seconds a resonable time? Why dispay an error message should it not be an information message giving the patient the option to wait longer or cancel? Is the error a separate requirement?

		[PC] The fit criterion does not need the "else provide an error indicating failure". This may well be a different requirement.
		
		[CG] agree with above regarding fit criterion: defining the system actions of a 'fail' state is a different requirement.
		
		[FM] Same as above comments, 8 seconds sounds too fast aswell it could take longer due to the patients connection

                [AL] agree remove the error message and update to limit success to 95% of cases as 100% of requests would be unrealistic.

		[SS] Would "indicate to the user that a problem has occurred" be better than provide an error. It gives more oportunity to the implementors to choose an appropriate way to convey the information.

                [OD] In my view this requirement is valid and its fit criterion testable as it stands.
		
		[MD] 8s would seem to be quite a slow response time.  The error message does not seem to fit the description of the NFR. 
             
                [AL] updated the reponse time based on feedback to 15 seconds.
 
                [AL] now updated the fit criterion based on feedback.
                
		[JM] Fit criterion seems good to me.     

		[CBB] 15s is a lot by today's standards but is sounds OK for the purpose of responding in a "reasonable" time.
		[PH] I agree that 15s is a lot however taking into account the possible complexity of the page and the backend it could absolutely be considered "reasonable". It is quite interesting to see this requirement "grow", the comments definitely improved it and it should pass as it stands
