REQ-ID: 	AL_BH028
Description: 	The patient shall receive the appointment booking information within a reasonable time
Type:  		Performance, Usability
Rationale: 	To provide a responsive appointment system that is usable and meets user ex-pectation.
Fit Criterion: 	The web page must respond with the appointment details within 8 seconds of the patients request else provide an error indicating failure. 
Originator: 	A Lebby
Comments: 	[AL] Requirement derived from functional requirements #028 – ‘The system should let patients view appointments on a website’.

Suggestion (hbraun): It's not clear how the response time limit is derived. Why exactly 8 seconds? I would suggest to improve the rational to explain how patients access the web site (mobile phone, dsl, etc) based on the technical constraints determine a reasonable response time limit.     
		
		[TM] What is the source of the 8 seconds? Is 8 seconds a resonable time? Why dispay an error message should it not be an information message giving the patient the option to wait longer or cancel? Is the error a separate requirement?

		[PC] The fit criterion does not need the "else provide an error indicating failure". This may well be a different requirement.
		
		[CG] agree with above regarding fit criterion: defining the system actions of a 'fail' state is a different requirement.
		
		[FM] Same as above comments, 8 seconds sounds too fast aswell it could take longer due to the patients connection
        
        [AP] Is there a way to link this specific requirement with AP_BH003? Tecnically they should be related somehow right ?!
