Comments:                  [OD] - Changing fit criterion to be more precise

			[TM] The fit criterion is a repeat of the NRF, better to state what should be shown i.e. only patient name to be made available to therapists. I am not sure the NFR makes sense because if the therapists sees 2 consecutive patients with the same name there has to be a way to differentiate between them e.g. by using address.

[HB] I agree with the need to consider privacy, data protection and legal constraints, but I think the rational and fit criterion would be better if derived from (or refering to) a regulation or security standard.
