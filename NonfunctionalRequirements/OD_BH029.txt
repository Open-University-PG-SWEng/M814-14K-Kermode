Description:               Personal details from patients must not be available to therapists   
Type:                      Security
Rationale:                 Patients personal details such as address, telephone number, email account, etc... are confidential and there is no business reason for therapist to know this information.
Fit Criterion:             The system must not show patients' personal details to therapist

Comments:                  [OD] - Changing fit criterion to be more precise

			[TM] The fit criterion is a repeat of the NRF, better to state what should be shown i.e. only patient name to be made available to therapists. I am not sure the NFR makes sense because if the therapists sees 2 consecutive patients with the same name there has to be a way to differentiate between them e.g. by using address.

[HB] I agree with the need to consider privacy, data protection and legal constraints, but I think the rational and fit criterion would be better if derived from (or refering to) a regulation or security standard.

[PC] Similar to other non-functional requirements that are absolute I thing that the fit criterion looks correct but very simple. This fit criterion is testable. There are many possible solutions to distinguish between clients of the same name and still meet these security requirements.

[CG] agree there is a need to clarify what type of data is or isn't allowed to be shown to therapists - the fit criterion as it stands is unrealistic.

[AP] Agree with the above. Note: It is interesting to see how a NFR might simply make the system unsuable if not done carrefully (problem with restricting data leading to making it impossible distingush two patients with the same name)
