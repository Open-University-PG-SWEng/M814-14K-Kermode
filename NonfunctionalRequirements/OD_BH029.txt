REQ-ID:                    OD_BH029
Description:               Personal details from patients must not be available to therapists   
Type:                      Security
Rationale:                 Patients personal details such as address, telephone number, email account, etc... are confidential and there is no business reason for therapist to know this information.
Fit Criterion:             The system must not show patients' personal details to therapist following the guidelines of the data protection act. The information available to therapist must be restricted to patient's full name, id, treatment history and any relevant medical condition.

Comments:                  [OD] - Derived from functional requirement REQ-ID #029
Comments:                  [OD] - Changing fit criterion to be more precise

			[TM] The fit criterion is a repeat of the NRF, better to state what should be shown i.e. only patient name to be made available to therapists. I am not sure the NFR makes sense because if the therapists sees 2 consecutive patients with the same name there has to be a way to differentiate between them e.g. by using address.

[HB] I agree with the need to consider privacy, data protection and legal constraints, but I think the rational and fit criterion would be better if derived from (or refering to) a regulation or security standard.

[PC] Similar to other non-functional requirements that are absolute I thing that the fit criterion looks correct but very simple. This fit criterion is testable. There are many possible solutions to distinguish between clients of the same name and still meet these security requirements.

[CG] agree there is a need to clarify what type of data is or isn't allowed to be shown to therapists - the fit criterion as it stands is unrealistic.

[AP] Agree with the above. Note: It is interesting to see how a NFR might simply make the system unsuable if not done carrefully (problem with restricting data leading to making it impossible distingush two patients with the same name)

[AL] agree a better fit criterion would state what information can be shown to therapists to make it more specific and testable, also maybe cite the relevant security standard for reference. 

[SS] Privacy does need considering but we need to define what is considered as "personal details". Relating this back to the data protection act would also be of benefit.

[OD] answer to [TM] [AP]: I agree that for completion it would be good to specifically state the information to be shown to therapists, however to suggest that the only way to differentiate two patients with the same name is to disclose personal information to unauthorised personnel, I think is simply wrong. There are many ways of achieving this differentiation without using personal information.

[OD] answer to [HB] [PC] [CG] [AL] [SS]: I agree with your point and changed the fit criterion accordingly.

[FM][OD] about your comment before wouldn't being able to just see name date of birth and last session date be the only things needed to differentiate between patients? Or using patient IDs?

[MD] This NFR has now neen modified by OD so my comments may clash with above.  Rather than list the allowable data, reference to a document, listing this and other system criteria, would aid maintainability.  

[JM] How does the therapist know whats "relevant" or the system. I think name, id are good also contact ifnromation in case you need to contact the patient, beyond that I dont think any other information is relevant, but if you think that is too narrow, perhaps a miscelanous informatioon section that can be used by therapist and receptionist alike to add any information they think is relevant about the patient, but not confidential.
