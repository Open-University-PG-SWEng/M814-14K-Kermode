REQ-ID: PH_BH006
Description:	The attribution of treatment types shall be future-proof
Type:			Maintainability 
Rationale:		The treatment types might change due to further training or cutbacks in workload and this should be represented in the system
Fit Criterion:	It shall be possible to change the values of the provided treatment types in the production system without re-shipment
Originator:		P Heuschkel
Quality Gateway:
Comments: 		Derived from the functional requirement #016. Might incentivise the creation of a new functional requirement for admin-access to pages and alterable data

[HB] I would change "future-proof" to "extensible". The fit criterion can be further improved by stating who is going to extend the treatment types: Is it the receptionist? A support engineer? This makes sure an appropriate mechanism is build into the product. 

[AP] I understand that this is a Maintainability type requirement, but isn't the Fit Criterion describing a Functional requirement ?
