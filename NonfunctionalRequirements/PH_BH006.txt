REQ-ID: PH_BH006
Description:	The attribution of treatment types shall be future-proof
Type:			Maintainability 
Rationale:		The treatment types might change due to further training or cutbacks in workload and this should be represented in the system
Fit Criterion:	It shall be possible for a selected subset of users to change the values of the provided treatment types with at most 2 user actions and without the need for technical assistance
Originator:		P Heuschkel
Quality Gateway:
Comments: 		Derived from the functional requirement #016. Might incentivise the creation of a new functional requirement for admin-access to pages and alterable data

[HB] I would change "future-proof" to "extensible". The fit criterion can be further improved by stating who is going to extend the treatment types: Is it the receptionist? A support engineer? This makes sure an appropriate mechanism is build into the product. 

[AP] I understand that this is a Maintainability type requirement, but isn't the Fit Criterion describing a Functional requirement ?

[PH] @HB Making it "extensible" and writing who will be able to do this both make this into a functional requirement in my opinion. Note that I only want to express a *quality* of the requirement (although it's a difficult one to express I admit)
[PH] @AP thanks for the hint, I think this captures it better

[TM] I would alter the fit criterion to mention administration of the treatment types by an appointed administrator because at the moment it could be read that the receptionist is changing the treatment type in normal use as opposed to through an administration interface. I would change the statement "without re-compiling the product" to "without the need for technical assistance"
